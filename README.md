# Reddit-Scraper
Scrape the subreddit, posts, comments from reddit related with stocks. Use the official API PRAW to grab data.

## Praw official tutorial: https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html

## This Juypterbook can achieve the following functions:  
    1. Get subreddit data: Grab data from specific subreddit, like Top10 hot posts in 'wallstreetbets'.
    2. Scrape the key word related posts and comments
    3. Scrape the relevant posts and comments (with specific stock symbols)
    

### ðŸŒŸAttention: It can not directly search for the comments in the Reddit. Therefore, I search for the posts and post related comments here.
